Some stuff I wanted to do, but I don't have enough time:
1. I wanted to prepare sync, since API is always the same, I pulled it just initially and
   saved all data to the local database. I wanted to do an API call every 24 hours, compare
   with data in the database, and update if necessary
2. handle errors, I prepared everything for errors (API and Database) but I just left todo comments
   UI is missing for that
3. I created a network observer, but I don't use it
4. Probably I missed some resources (dimensions for example) may be also strings
5. Unit tests I added only for domain layer
